## 💡 Tips for Best Results

### Writing Effective Prompts
- **Be Specific**: Describe scenes, lighting, camera angles, and mood
- **Include Details**: Mention colors, textures, movements, and transitions
- **Use Film Terminology**: Words like "pan," "zoom," "close-up," "wide shot"
- **Specify Style**: "cinematic lighting," "dramatic atmosphere," "vintage film look"

### Example Prompts

#### Video Generation
```
Create a 3-minute cinematic video showing a futuristic city at sunset with flying cars, 
holographic advertisements, and people walking through neon-lit streets. The camera 
should pan from left to right, revealing the cityscape gradually. Include ambient city 
sounds and background music. Style: Cinematic, 4K quality, dramatic lighting.
```

#### Image Generation
```
A professional portrait of a woman in her 30s with curly hair, wearing a business suit, 
standing in a modern office with floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking a city skyline. 
Soft natural lighting, shallow depth of field, professional photography style.
```

#### Script Generation
```
A short story about a young scientist who discovers a way to communicate with plants, 
leading to a secret society of botanists who have been protecting ancient forests. 
Create a screenplay with dialogue, scene descriptions, and character development.
